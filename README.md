Symmetric Encryption - Decryption Simulation

Overview

It is a GUI-based application designed for symmetric encryption and decryption simulations. It allows users to encrypt plain text using the AES algorithm and decrypt the generated cipher text back into its original form.

Features

Symmetric Encryption: Encrypts user input using the AES algorithm.

Decryption: Decrypts previously encrypted text back to plain text.

Key Generation: Automatically generates encryption keys for secure encoding.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple UI for encryption and decryption operations.

How to Use

Encrypting Text:

Enter the text to encrypt.

Select the encryption algorithm (AES is currently supported).

Click on the "Process" button to encrypt the text.

The generated key will be displayed in the output field.

Decrypting Text:

Copy the generated key from the encryption process.

Paste the key into the decryption input field.

Click "Clear" to reset or use the outputted plain text.
